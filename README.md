- 👋 Hi, I’m @FD81, a lecturer of politics and international relations.
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of Natural Language Processing to analyse dynamics of change in the political identity of Islamist movements.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn as much as I can about NLP and the related coding activities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with data scientists that are interested in this type of project, in particular if they have experience with Arabic NLP.
- 📫 How to reach me: best thing is to look me up on a search engine and contact me through my University of Bristol email.
